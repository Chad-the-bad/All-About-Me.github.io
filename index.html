    <h2 id="infoboutmoi">I enjoy coding a lot, and have a bit of experience in a handful of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, C, and C++.
      Soon, I'm going to start an online course that teaches Ruby (<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby" target="_blank">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby</a>)
      I realized I had an aptitude for coding when I was in fifth grade, when I took a basic course on codecademy about HTML (<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-HTML" target="_blank">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html</a>).
      After doing some lessons, I found myself enjoying the material. This stuck with me until eighth grade, when my school offered a Python elective.
      I caught on to the new language very easily, and managed to make a game similar to the Google no-wifi game, with a character dodging obstacles.
While this game was never fully finished, it was programmed well enough to work successfully without any errors.
Going into ninth grade, this love of Python stayed with me, increasing my enthusiasm for my schoolâ€™s computer science class, which was an easy A+ class for me.
In addition to the computer science class, we were offered an optional Girls Who Code after school club. I opted in, and had a wonderful time for the entire year. The program ran once a week, for two hours every Wednesday evening.
Though I had plenty of homework, I was always able to take these two hours out without a worry of my homework load.
